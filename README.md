# Granny

Granny doesn't tolerate Millennial and Gen-Z antics. So watch yourself, son!

- She will correct you if you use the wrong pronouns, and she will not be nice about it.
- Using foul language will get you a mouthful of soap.
- She will not tolerate any of your "woke" nonsense.
- Granny is a proud lover of cats, and she will not hesitate to tell you about her cats.
