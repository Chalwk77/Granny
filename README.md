Granny doesn't tolerate Millennial and Gen-Z antics. So watch yourself, son!

- She will correct you if you use the wrong pronouns, and she will not be pleasant.
- Using foul language will get you a mouthful of soap.
- She will not tolerate any of your "woke" nonsense.
- Granny is a proud lover of cats, and she will not hesitate to tell you about her cats.
- Granny served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) during World War II, and you will hear endless stories about her time there.
- Granny dislikes it when you use the lord's name in vain.
